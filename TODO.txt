Pri 0
- It's not possible to create a model that works both on server and client. The reason is that client model has RO references and server model has R/W reference.
- Fix StructArray (test) scenario. The current test uses Set method. It needs to work with natural properties.
- PoleArray should be a buffer, not an object, i.e. it needs to be able to span multiple segments of memory
- ByteBuffer should be a sequence of segments
- simplify server parser for request data, i.e. reading from a pipeline
- implement roundtrip (in-out and out-in) models for the client
- remove all deserialize methods and add ctors that take BinaryData. But what about multi-buffer?
- make header structured (len, version, etc.)
- make sure multi-buffer server code works
- implement client/server performance test
- object array
- alow for composing objects, i.e. object inline in anothere object
- allow arrays be inline in objects
- finish support for child types
- support dictionaries

Pri 1
- cleanup models based on client/server sample
- too memory inefficient with all these type IDs
	a) make ID smaller and have longer payload header ID
	b) make IDs be debug only
- can model variants be consolidated/simplified?
- finish generator
- support generating client + server
- support other languages
- too much code relies on single buffer sequences.

Pri 2
- support for converting from JSON
- support for buffers (Span<byte>)
- support System.IO.Pipelines
- support multi-segment heap
- support null references
- polymorphism?
- add PoleWriter (forward only writer for trees) - what to do with strings. i.e. how to write both object and string?
- add PoleReader (forward only reader)
- add editor browsable
